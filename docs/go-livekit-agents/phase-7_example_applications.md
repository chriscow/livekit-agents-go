# Phase 7 â€“ Example Applications

> Timeline target: **Week 13â€“14**

Ship runnable demos that mirror Python examples plus a new Go-native one.

---

## 1. Goals & Deliverables

| ID | Deliverable | Description |
|----|-------------|-------------|
| P7-D1 | `examples/echo_bot` | Voice agent that echoes user speech |
| P7-D2 | `examples/drive_thru` | Port of Python drive-thru demo |
| P7-D3 | `examples/cli_tool_call` | Demonstrate function-calling with tools |
| P7-D4 | README docs | Step-by-step run instructions |

---

## 2. Implementation Steps

1. **Echo Bot** â€“ instantiate Agent with `fake` STT/TTS and run locally.
2. **Drive-Thru** â€“ reuse menu logic from Python, translate to Go.
3. **Tool-Call Demo** â€“ expose `weather.today` function, call OpenAI.
4. **Add `make examples`** â€“ builds and runs Echo Bot in headless mode.

---

## 3. Testing & Acceptance

* CI job runs Echo Bot for 5 s with prerecorded audio, asserts echoed packet count.
* Drive-Thru passes order string regression test (`2x burger`).
* All READMEs render without broken links (link checker action).

## 4. Python Reference Map

| Example | Python location | Go folder |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Echo agent | `examples/primitives/echo-agent.py` | `examples/echo_bot` |
| Drive-thru | `examples/drive-thru` | `examples/drive_thru` |
